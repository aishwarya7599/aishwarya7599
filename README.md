[cite_start]I am a Master's in Business Analytics candidate at the Isenberg School of Management, UMass Amherst, expecting to graduate in Fall 2025[cite: 23, 96]. [cite_start]I thrive at the intersection of business and technology, focusing on using data to fix inefficiencies and create impactful solutions[cite: 26]. [cite_start]In addition to my studies, I currently serve as the Vice President of Operations & Marketing for the Graduate Women in Business[cite: 42].

[cite_start]My academic journey is built on a foundation of four transformative years at ExxonMobil[cite: 24], where I honed my skills in data analysis, operations, and vendor management. Some highlights include:
- [cite_start]As a **Business Intelligence Data Analyst**, I developed comprehensive SLA, KPI, and customer experience (XLA) dashboards for internal products using Tableau, Power BI, and ServiceNow[cite: 60].
- [cite_start]I performed in-depth analysis of ticketing data, which led to improved ticket health and reduced volume through the implementation of automated solutions[cite: 62].
- [cite_start]As a **Business Analyst for Retail**, I managed Security and Controls for a vendor team of 70 members [cite: 69] [cite_start]and oversaw help desk reporting for 14,000 gas station sites across North America[cite: 70].

[cite_start]More recently, I completed an IT Contracts and Vendor Management internship at Batesville[cite: 25, 32], where I:
- [cite_start]Developed interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI, SQL, Excel, and Smartsheet to enhance leadership visibility[cite: 35, 36].
- [cite_start]Streamlined vendor management processes and automated trackers, leading to increased operational efficiency[cite: 37, 38].

[cite_start]I am now advancing my expertise in Python and MySQL and have begun an AI journey, exploring how emerging technologies like those from Hugging Face can be used to drive smarter, real-world decisions[cite: 27].
