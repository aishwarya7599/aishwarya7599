I am a Master's in Business Analytics candidate at the Isenberg School of Management, UMass Amherst, expecting to graduate in Dec 2025. I thrive at the intersection of business and technology, focusing on using data to fix inefficiencies and create impactful solutions. In addition to my studies, I currently serve as the Vice President of Operations & Marketing for the Graduate Women in Business.

I am now advancing my expertise in Python and MySQL and have begun an AI journey, exploring how emerging technologies like those from Hugging Face can be used to drive smarter, real-world decisions.
