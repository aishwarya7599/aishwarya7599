I am a Master's in Business Analytics candidate at the Isenberg School of Management, UMass Amherst, expecting to graduate in Fall 2025. I thrive at the intersection of business and technology, focusing on using data to fix inefficiencies and create impactful solutions. In addition to my studies, I currently serve as the Vice President of Operations & Marketing for the Graduate Women in Business.

My academic journey is built on a foundation of four transformative years at ExxonMobil, where I honed my skills in data analysis, operations, and vendor management. Some highlights include:
- As a **Business Intelligence Data Analyst**, I developed comprehensive SLA, KPI, and customer experience (XLA) dashboards for internal products using Tableau, Power BI, and ServiceNow.
- I performed in-depth analysis of ticketing data, which led to improved ticket health and reduced volume through the implementation of automated solutions.
- As a **Business Analyst for Retail**, I managed Security and Controls for a vendor team of 70 members and oversaw help desk reporting for 14,000 gas station sites across North America.

More recently, I completed an IT Contracts and Vendor Management internship at Batesville, where I:
- Developed interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI, SQL, Excel, and Smartsheet to enhance leadership visibility.
- Streamlined vendor management processes and automated trackers, leading to increased operational efficiency.

I am now advancing my expertise in Python and MySQL and have begun an AI journey, exploring how emerging technologies like those from Hugging Face can be used to drive smarter, real-world decisions.
